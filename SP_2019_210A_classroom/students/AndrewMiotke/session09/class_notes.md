# Week 9 Class Notes

### Multiple Inheritance
* take two or more class attributes to create a new object(class)
* `super()` allows you to call methods in other classes
* If you have a class named `D` use `mro()` to see the order that the methods will run in. `D.mro()`
* Use build in functions when you can, like `sum()` and `len()`
