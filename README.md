# University of Washington Python Class

These repos are a collection of the Python class I took at the
University of Washington in 2019.

Some of these repos were orignally forked from other repos
that contained the instructions for an assignment. Some of
those were from "pcewebpython", "UWPCE-PythonCert-ClassRepos".
