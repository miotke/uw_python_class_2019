Setting up your repo
####################

1. Create a directory for yourself here
2. Copy the contents of the template_student directory into your new directory
3. Be sure to copy not move!!
4. You will then have all the lessons directories under here
5. Back in the project parent directory, first make sure python -V shows 3.7.x
6. If not, download and install python 3.7 and be sure it is the first python on your path
7. Run python -m venv venv
8. Always source venv/bin/activate (mac/Liux) or venv\Scripts\activate (windows)
9. run pip install -r requirements.txt (you only need to do this once after install)
10. Take a look in the sample directory to see how to run python, pytest, pylint, and coverage,
   and how to use import in your tests and modules
